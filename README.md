### Streamlit Optimization Demo

This Streamlit app demonstrates the optimization process using a simple quadratic loss function. Users can interact with the app by adjusting the optimization parameter.

#### How to Run

1. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run your_script_name.py
   ```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script containing the provided code.

#### Functionality

- Use the slider to adjust the optimization parameter.
- The app will show the changes in weights and losses during the optimization process.
- In case the optimization explodes, an error message will be displayed.

#### File Structure

- `your_script_name.py`: The main Python script containing the Streamlit app.
- `requirements.txt`: File specifying the required Python libraries and versions.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the app.
